This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

First install yarn

### `brew install yarn`

Use your favorite package manager to install yarn!

### `yarn`

Running yarn checks all the dependency and wraps around npm to download the specific versions you need

### `yarn start`

Yarn start serves up the react and live reloads.
This means you can edit code and the react will automatically reloads at localhost :)
You can now view your app at localhost

* To have your local frontend communicate with the dev server: configure your api base url like so: `export const API_BASE_URL = 'http://api.dev.marcopolo.com';`
* or just edit your env file variables which will be pulled from `src/utils/config.js`  the backend
* your env files are ignored from git! so don't worry ;)
* make sure you have the [backend](https://?) running
* run `something` to serve the site :)

###If you're weird and prefer npm

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
